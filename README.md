#Section 1
## Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
* "Theatre - plays" have been the most popular campaigns for crowdfunding. "Film & Video" and "Music" lie second in line for popular crowdfunding campaigns but are half as popular as Theatre.
* The best commencement month of campaigns over 10 years were July and January with July being the most successful as per (success/fail ratio)
* US got the most funding in overall countries. US has 73% of total crowdfunding with 77% of total successful projects and 75% of total failed projects with "theatre - play" being the most popular project to be invested in the US.
## What are some limitations of this dataset?
* They don't estimate the overall expenditure of launching these projects limiting our grasp on the profits/money we could raise from them.
* There's no way to estimate the non-tangible requirements of launching these campaigns like the talent/effort/resources in terms of raw materials, human headcount, knowledge of subject etc
* The data does not give full information on the time required to develop theproduct/service/kind of expertise required to launch these campaigns.
* Not enough information for the recent years and 2020 has data only for january
## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
* I used an Overall rating metric = (Succes*Total number of projects/Failure) and "Theatre - plays" look to be the safest and most popular campaigns for crowdfunding throughout. It is the top invested category from 2010-2020 with most invested in 2010 and having the all time highest success rate(succes/failure) during 2017.
* The average number of projects funded over 2010-2019 were 98 with a stdev of 8.3 indicating the obverall popularity of crowdfunding is high making it a lucrative/potential option to launch products (not considering 2020 as only includes jan data making it incomplete set of data)
* Mobile games are the worst projects to launch, they not only remain less popular among backers but their success/fail ratio is also quite low and requires a different set of expertise to develop the product.

## Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
## Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
